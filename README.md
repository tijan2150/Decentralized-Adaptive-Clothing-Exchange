# Decentralized Adaptive Clothing Exchange

A blockchain-based platform that connects individuals with disabilities and unique clothing needs to specialized adaptive garments, facilitates modifications, and enables the sharing of successful design patterns.

## Overview

The Decentralized Adaptive Clothing Exchange creates an inclusive ecosystem where people with disabilities, caregivers, designers, and makers can collaborate to address the significant gap in accessible clothing options. This platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and fair exchange of adaptive clothing while building a growing knowledge base of successful modifications.

## Core Components

### Garment Registration Contract

This smart contract records essential details about adaptive clothing items:

- Garment specifications (size, fabric, features)
- Adaptive elements (magnetic closures, sensory-friendly materials, etc.)
- Condition assessment
- Original designer/manufacturer
- Current owner
- Production date
- Washing/care instructions
- Photography and measurements
- Accessibility features categorization

### Needs Matching Contract

This contract connects available adaptive clothing with individuals who need them:

- User profiles with specific clothing needs
- Privacy-preserving needs specification
- Intelligent matching algorithms
- Geographical proximity calculations
- Reputation system for reliable exchanges
- Notification system for potential matches
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Optional priority system for urgent needs

### Modification Tracking Contract

This contract documents the adaptation of garments for specific disabilities:

- Modification details and techniques
- Before/after documentation
- Materials used
- Time investment
- Skill level required
- Success metrics and feedback
- Modification history for each garment
- Links to instructional resources

### Design Sharing Contract

This contract facilitates the exchange of successful clothing patterns:

- Pattern specifications and templates
- Creative Commons licensing options
- Designer attribution
- Version control for iterative improvements
- Community rating system
- Difficulty assessment
- Material recommendations
- Success stories and testimonials
- Integration with digital fabrication tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   cd adaptive-clothing-exchange
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration values.

4. Deploy the contracts:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Registering a Garment

1. Navigate to the "Register Garment" section
2. Connect your wallet
3. Complete the garment details form
4. Upload clear photographs of the item

6. Publish design for community access
7. Track usage and collect improvement suggestions

## Technical Architecture

The platform combines several technologies:

- Smart contracts on Ethereum (or compatible L2 solution for lower gas fees)
- IPFS for decentralized storage of images and patterns
- Web3 front-end for intuitive user interaction
- Optional integration with maker spaces and fabrication labs
- Mobile-friendly responsive design for accessibility
- Integration with assistive technologies

## Privacy and Ethical Considerations

- Optional anonymity for users with sensitive needs
- Consent-based information sharing
- No storage of medical records or diagnoses
- Focus on functional needs rather than medical conditions
- Community guidelines emphasizing respect and dignity
- Transparent governance with disability community representation

## Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Launch of garment registration and needs matching
- **Q3 2025**: Implementation of modification tracking functionality
- **Q4 2025**: Release of design sharing capabilities
- **Q1 2026**: Integration with maker spaces and fabrication labs
- **Q2 2026**: Mobile app release with enhanced accessibility features

## Impact Metrics

The platform tracks the following impact metrics:

- Number of successful matches
- Garments kept out of landfills
- Time saved in finding appropriate clothing
- Cost savings compared to custom solutions
- Growth of the adaptive design knowledge base
- Geographic reach and community diversity
